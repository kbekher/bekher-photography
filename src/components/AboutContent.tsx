            I mix street, nature, architecture and many aspects of everyday life. I like shooting anything that seems interesting and experimenting with light, gear, and color.

              My first ever film camera was an old rangefinder, the FED 5. It took me some time to get used to it, but eventually, I was shooting with it up until 2022, and I did much better with the rangefinder than with SLRs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2022, a new chapter began with the Japanese Minolta SR-1s. I was really impressed by the shots I got and realized that the older gear I&apos;d been using does have its limits. That same year, the Pentax 17 was announced by Asahi Optical, and I&apos;d been looking forward to it ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the Pentax 17 finally came out, I soon found myself unboxing my first &lsquo;new&rsquo; camera. I loved its small size and cool design. And even though I like setting the aperture manually, Pentax still lets me experiment with exposure, modes, and focus â€” which takes some getting used to.
            </p>

              Recently, my friends added a Canon AE-1 to my kit. With its automatic aperture exposure, I worry less about missing moments. Paired with a Rolev M.G. 55mm Skylight filter on the lens, the images I&apos;m getting are absolutely incredible. Still exploring...            </p>
